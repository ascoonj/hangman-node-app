Hangman Node App
This hangman node app is a command line Hangman game developed to practice the use of Object Constructors and Prototypes, while also honing the use of Node.js and NPM.

Behind the scenes the app uses object constructors to create letter and word objects that contain properties and protype functions. The functions are used to manipulate and present the properties to the user such that letters are initially hidden until the user correctly guesse and reveals them.

The app uses the NPM package [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and practices passing code/ functions from one file to another by requiring them as needed.

See a sample of the running app below:
